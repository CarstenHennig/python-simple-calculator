# Turing College, batch DS_01_2023
## Sprint 1 Python Mastery
### Done by Carsten Hennig

A simple Python package with initializing *__init__.py* file importing after delay of 3 seconds the *calculator.py* file.

Calculator function offers simple computing operations:
- add | substract | multiply | divide
- square root
- memory function

Still to develop:
1. Re-use memorized number
2. GUI template
3. Figure out how to check input numbers properly if them are integers or floats and not a string or containing letters or special characters
4. How to install documentation
